![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malviyaHimanshu/arweave-hackathon/main/images/chart.jpeg))
### when ever the code is pushed following functions are executed
- a new workflow is inserted into the users github
- python script is injected into his github
- workflow runs the python script which then connects with ardrive and pushes it

### Arsync
Arsync is the managing layer that interacts with all the components to create a seamless workflow experience
- it manages Environment variables
- securely connects ardrive and github
- there is no virtual server used , hence its completely decentralized ignoring the web2 github
- managing of the licenses are also done here

### python script
- manages the build files in github actions
- pushes the build file to ardrive
- creates license
- creates manifests and uploads the hosted link into the github about sectionüöÄ



# What's next ?
- We are trying to add support for environment variables.
- We can add testing/checking the builds for vulnerabilities and security issues before deploying them directly in arweave.
- We would like to support for more range of frameworks like VueJS, AngularJS etc. and even provide support for database.
